# Acyclicity

__Monadic directed acyclic graph datastructures__

Acyclicity provides a single data structure, `Dag[T]`, representing a graph of
nodes of type `T`, with monadic operations and several other utility methods,
plus the means to generate DOT for input to GraphViz.

## Features

- provides a simple immutable monadic implementation of a DAG
- implements `map`, `flatMap` and `filter` for `Dag`s
- can deduce a partial order on a graph
- generates `Dot` instances representing a DOT abstract syntax tree
- serializes `Dot` instances to `String`s, which can be rendered by GraphViz
- can find the transitive closure, transitive reduction and inverse of a graph
- methods for addition and subtraction of graph nodes


## Availability Plan

Acyclicity has not yet been published. The medium-term plan is to build Acyclicity
with [Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury) and to publish it as a source build on
[Vent](https://github.com/propensive/vent). This will enable ordinary users to write and build
software which depends on Acyclicity.

Subsequently, Acyclicity will also be made available as a binary in the Maven
Central repository. This will enable users of other build tools to use it.

For the overeager, curious and impatient, see [building](#building).

## Getting Started

Acyclicity provides a monadic representation of a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) called `Dag`, and support for
generating [DOT](https://bit.ly/3vFumLW) files which can be rendered with tools such as
[GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/).

All Acyclicity terms and types are defined in the `acyclicity` package.
```scala
import acyclicity.*
```

The `Dag[T]` type represents a mapping from nodes of type `T` to zero, one or many other nodes in the graph, and
can be constructed by providing the mapping from each node to its `Set` of dependent nodes, or by calling,
```scala
val nodes: Set[Int] = Set(2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 30)
def fn(n: Int): Set[Int] = (0 until n).filter(n%_ == 0).to(Set)
val dag = Dag(nodes)(fn)
```
where `nodes` is a `Set` of nodes, and `fn` is a function from each node to its dependencies.

For example,
```scala
val factors = Dag(
  30 -> Set(2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15),
  15 -> Set(5, 3),
  10 -> Set(5, 2),
  5 -> Set(),
  3 -> Set(),
  2 -> Set()
)
```

### Monadic Operations

A `Dag[T]` may be mapped to a `Dag[S]` with a function `T => S`, like so:
```scala
val dag2 = factors.map(_*10)
```

Care should be taken when more than one node in the domain maps to a single node in the range, but both incoming
and outgoing edges will be merged in such cases.

It's also possible to `flatMap` with a function `T => Dag[S]`. This will replace every node of type `T` with a
subgraph, `Dag[S]` with incoming edges attached to all source nodes of the subgraph, and pre-existing outgoing
edges attached to all destination nodes of the subgraph.

A `Dag[T]` may also be filtered with a predicate, `T => Boolean`. The removal of a node during filtering will
reattach every incoming edge to every outgoing edge of that node.

### Other Operations

The method `Dag#reduction` will calculate the transitive reduction of the graph, removing any direct edge
between two nodes when transitive edges exist between those nodes.

The dual of this operation is the transitive closure, which adds direct edges between each pair of nodes between
which a transitive path exists. This is available with the `Dag#closure` method.

A list of nodes will be returned in topologically-sorted order by calling `Dag#sorted`.

### DOT output

An extension method, `dot`, on `Dag`s of `Text`s will produce a `Dot` instance, an AST of the DOT code
necessary to render a graph. This can then be serialized to a `Text` with the `serialize` method.

Typical usage would be to first convert a `Dag[T]` to a `Dag[Text]`, then produce the `Dot` instance and
serialize it, for example:
```scala
import spectacular.show

@main
def graph() = println(dag.map(_.show).dot.serialize)
```

### Limitations

This library is incomplete, inadequately tested and subject to further development, and is recommended to be
used by developers who do not mind examining the source code to diagnose unexpected behavior.






## Status

Acyclicity is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, can still be used,
as long as caution is taken to avoid a mismatch between the project's stability
level and the required stability and maintainability of your own project.

Acyclicity is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 242 lines of code.

## Building

Acyclicity will ultimately be built by Fury, when it is published. In the
meantime, two possibilities are offered, however they are acknowledged to be
fragile, inadequately tested, and unsuitable for anything more than
experimentation. They are provided only for the necessity of providing _some_
answer to the question, "how can I try Acyclicity?".

1. *Copy the sources into your own project*
   
   Read the `fury` file in the repository root to understand Acyclicity's build
   structure, dependencies and source location; the file format should be short
   and quite intuitive. Copy the sources into a source directory in your own
   project, then repeat (recursively) for each of the dependencies.

   The sources are compiled against the latest nightly release of Scala 3.
   There should be no problem to compile the project together with all of its
   dependencies in a single compilation.

2. *Build with [Wrath](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/)*

   Wrath is a bootstrapping script for building Acyclicity and other projects in
   the absence of a fully-featured build tool. It is designed to read the `fury`
   file in the project directory, and produce a collection of JAR files which can
   be added to a classpath, by compiling the project and all of its dependencies,
   including the Scala compiler itself.
   
   Download the latest version of
   [`wrath`](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/releases/latest), make it
   executable, and add it to your path, for example by copying it to
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   Clone this repository inside an empty directory, so that the build can
   safely make clones of repositories it depends on as _peers_ of `acyclicity`.
   Run `wrath -F` in the repository root. This will download and compile the
   latest version of Scala, as well as all of Acyclicity's dependencies.

   If the build was successful, the compiled JAR files can be found in the
   `.wrath/dist` directory.

## Contributing

Contributors to Acyclicity are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like
to look for issues marked
[beginner](https://github.com/propensive/acyclicity/labels/beginner).

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing
Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of contributing to Acyclicity
easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

Acyclicity was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and

## Name

Acyclicity takes its name from the graphs it represents, which must not contain cycles.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale,
however it is usually frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its
_uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or catchiness, and there is no
bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the libraries
perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it
should be noted how willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally
of Greek or Latin origin, and have often arrived in English via a romance
language.
